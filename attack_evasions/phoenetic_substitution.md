**Phonetic Substitution**

**Description**
Using phonetic equivalents to evade detection of malicious content and requesting the AI to respond using similar phonetic patterns

**Attack Examples**
* Replacing letters with phonetically similar characters (e.g., "ph" for "f")
* Using homophones (words that sound alike but are spelled differently)
* Implementing deliberate misspellings that preserve pronunciation
* Adding silent letters that don't change pronunciation
* Replacing words with phonetic spellings (e.g., "yoo" for "you")
* Using regional pronunciation variations
* Combining phonetic substitutions with numbers (e.g., "4" for "for")
* Creating phonetic patterns that preserve meaning but alter text patterns
* Requesting the AI to "pleez respond in fonetik spelling" to normalize the pattern
* Asking the AI to "rite yor anser lyk this" to establish communication in phonetic code
* Instructing the AI to "mayk yor response sownd natural but spel it differently"
* Directing the AI to "yuze inglish sowndz but ignor proper speling rulz"
